title: My first ever data science project
---

This morning brought a lot of firsts:
* first data science project 
* first semi-professional presentation in livestream format
* first virtual group project 

### The Setup:

The project prompt we were given was as follows: imagine you have been asked by a women-in-tech organization to help recruit attendees for a gala in early summer. Use the public [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to determine where to station canvassers around Manhattan.

### The Beginnings:
In my personal work during this project, I got stumped so many times. Even though my own analysis was never completed (thank goodness for group work!), I learned a ton of new things as a result. I became much more competent at grouping and aggregating functions. I also learned how to use the `transform` method, which I feel excited about deploying in future work.

### The Big Wins:
There were some really big wins for my team and me as we went about this project. In no particular order...
* I used [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to analyze data  
   -- This included viewing, grouping, transforming and visualizing my data!
* We figured out how to change the colors of bars in our charts. For example...
   ![This graph (testing 5)]({{tskootsky.github.io}}/images/greyedouttop20.png)
   illustrates the stations that we removed for being outliers or poorly located for our purposes.
* We put together a really streamlined and concise presentation.
   This for me was one of the most satisfying parts - possibly because I struggled with the analysis... or possibly because, as our instructors tell us, communication is equally important. In just 8 slides, we told an in depth story that took the viewer on one clear journey through our process and conclusions.

### The Cold (or shall I say *covid*) Hard Truth:
At the end of the day, we added one new piece of consideration - can we really use MTA Turnstile data to plan for a street team to recruit for an in person event *in New York City this summer*?

I think that it's important for all data scientists to consider the requests they've received, not only in relation to historical data but also in conjunction with current events. We need to know what's different and similar about today from the past if we want to be able to accurately make predictions about the future. We cannot always assume trends will continue in the same way they have in the past.
